# Algorithmic Trading Bot Viability Review

## 1. Code stability, cleanliness, and extensibility
- The repository mixes backtesting utilities with live-trading scripts but lacks a cohesive application entry point; e.g., `main.py` only wires a single strategy and commented-out runner logic, leaving no orchestrated runtime or dependency management. This makes iterative development harder because there is no clear configuration surface or packaging story. 【F:main.py†L1-L34】
- The backtesting engine introduces sensible helpers (column normalization, required-column checks, ATR-based position sizing, transaction cost accounting) that could support iteration, but the code stops processing entirely when inputs are missing instead of surfacing actionable errors or defaults, and there is no surrounding test suite to guard changes. 【F:src/backtest/backtester.py†L25-L112】
- Risk controls live only in config dataclasses and aren’t enforced in live bots; the crypto bot calculates signals, writes them to CSV, and loops every 60 seconds without persistence, monitoring, or structured logging, which increases operational fragility and complicates debugging. 【F:src/backtest/config.py†L5-L23】【F:src/bots/crypto/rsi_crossover.py†L20-L160】
- Strategy modules are generally single-function scripts with hard-coded parameters and minimal documentation (e.g., moving-average crossover calculates signals but never wires execution or risk controls), which limits reusability and requires manual edits to tune or compose strategies. 【F:src/strategies/moving_average_crossover.py†L4-L10】

## 2. Evaluation of implemented trading strategies
- **Crypto RSI crossover bot:** Combines 9/21 EMA crossovers with RSI thresholds of 50/25 but only triggers buys; sells are commented out and orders always allocate ~2% of buying power with fixed 10% stop-loss and 20% take-profit regardless of volatility. This asymmetric, long-only behavior on minute bars lacks exit logic for failed signals and ignores slippage/fees, making it operationally and financially risky. 【F:src/bots/crypto/rsi_crossover.py†L41-L136】
- **RSI crossover backtest:** Uses an unusually short 3-period RSI with static 30/70 thresholds and fixed 5% stop-loss / 1% take-profit. Positions flip between 1 and -1 without position sizing, liquidity checks, or slippage modeling, so reported performance will likely be overstated and unstable across assets. 【F:src/strategies/rsi_crossover_strategy.py†L14-L65】
- **VWAP long/short strategy:** Trades minute bars whenever price crosses VWAP and forces flat positions at a hard-coded “market close” time, but lacks daily resets, volume/volatility filters, or transaction-cost modeling. Entry price lookup uses the first matching timestamp each loop iteration, which can mis-handle duplicate timestamps and distort returns. 【F:src/strategies/vwap_long_short_strategy.py†L18-L144】
- **Moving-average crossover:** Implements classic short/long moving-average signals but stops at signal generation; there is no backtest harness connection or risk/position sizing, so it serves more as a stub than a deployable strategy. 【F:src/strategies/moving_average_crossover.py†L4-L10】

## 3. Profitability outlook
- The codebase emphasizes indicator-based heuristics without robust validation. Backtests omit broker fees for live crypto trading, market impact, and realistic order routing, so any simulated edge is likely overstated. The live bot’s lack of exit logic and reliance on current-minute data increases exposure to whipsaws and exchange outages. 【F:src/bots/crypto/rsi_crossover.py†L83-L160】【F:src/strategies/rsi_crossover_strategy.py†L14-L65】
- Risk management is inconsistent: backtest configs include ATR-based sizing and capital caps, but live execution bypasses these controls and hard-codes 2% notional buys, leaving the system sensitive to drawdowns and sudden volatility. 【F:src/backtest/config.py†L5-L23】【F:src/bots/crypto/rsi_crossover.py†L117-L136】
- Given the simplicity of the strategies, absence of statistical validation, and operational gaps (logging, monitoring, testing), profitability is unlikely without substantial redevelopment. The existing code can serve as a learning scaffold, but it would require rigorous data validation, execution safeguards, and more sophisticated models before being production-ready. 【F:src/backtest/backtester.py†L77-L112】【F:src/bots/crypto/rsi_crossover.py†L20-L160】
